This means that the two particles become intimately connected, even though they may be separated in space. This phenomena is so strange that Albert Einstein famously referred to it as \"spooky action at a distance\". \n\nThe particles can be in the same place or be many miles apart and still remain linked. When something changes to one particle, it immediately affects the other particle, regardless of the distance that separates them. This instantaneous response is known as quantum nonlocality and is a direct consequence of quantum entanglement. \n\nThe state of a particle can be thought of as a combination of its spin, momentum, and position. When two particles become entangled, their quantum states are linked in such a way that the state of one particle will determine the state of the other. This means that if two entangled particles were placed at opposite ends of the universe, they would remain connected and respond to each other instantaneously."}}
