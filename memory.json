With either of these methods you will be able to programmatically download, install, and run updates to your GitHub repository. For example, with Requests you could use the get() to make a request to the GitHub repo, then use Response.content to get the data, then use a function to process the data and install or run an update. With the GitHub API, you could use the Repository Contents API to pull down a file and make an update, or use webhooks to create an automatic update."}}
