This will create a heightened sense of tension and require careful planning and execution to succeed. Along with this mechanic, the game will have the character switching from Nier: Automata, where players will switch between two characters in the middle of the game.\n\nEach stage will offer a unique challenge as the player progresses towards their ultimate goal.\"", "response": " Possible Main Loop of the Game:\n1.
